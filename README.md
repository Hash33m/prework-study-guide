# <Prework-Study-Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Study Guide was created for bootcamp students who are going through the Prework. My motivation was to find a way to keep track of the prework by making a study guide in a simple web application. I've built this project to help other students get a better understanding of the course material. With so much information for boot camp students, it can be overwhelming at times to keep track of this information. My project helps solve that problem. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

Create a new repository on GitHub.com.
Open Terminal.
Change the current working directory to your local project.
Use the init command to initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
Add the files in your new local repository.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For Suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I(MacOS) or Control+Shift+I(Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
